    <!--Lab 0 - Tutorial 1-->
    <h3>Lab 0</h3>
    <p>On Tuesday, January 22nd, 2019, during the first lab of the course CIS 3342, first I mapped the X: drive to my website 
        on cis-iis2.temple.edu by entering the network folder path \\cis-iis2.temple.edu\wwwroot$\Spring2019\CIS3342_tug13955</p>
    <p>Second, I created an ASP web application solution in Visual Studio and saved it G:\cis3342 folder. Inside the solution, 
        I then created a test project with a HTML file named ‘index.html’. After creating the solution and the test project, 
        I connected to the database server cis-mssql1.temple.edu from Visual Studio by following the tutorial: entering server name, 
        choosing authentication, and entering user name and password. Once I logged in, I found my database sp19_3342_tug13955 
        and I knew I was successfully connected.</p>
    <p>Finally, I followed the tutorial to publish the test project. After publishing from Visual Studio, 
        I entered my website URL to the browser to make sure it was published successfully, 
        then made few changes in the project and published again. </p>
    <p>In the end, I closed Visual Studio and opened it again for few more times. 
        This is the URL to my test website from Lab 1: http://cis-iis2.temple.edu/Spring2019/CIS3342_tug13955</p>
    <!--Project 1-->
    <h3>Project 1</h3>
    <p>This is the first project of the CIS 3342 - Server-Side Web Application Development.
        In this project, I learned how to create a web application with a simple HTML page with a form processed by the ASPX server-side page
        that respond to the request from the HTML page.</p>
    <p>This first project was a useful guide to help me starting undestanding how Client-side and Server-side web application
        communicate to each other. Overall, the project was simple once I fully understand the concept and how to process it,
        though it was a bit confusing at first, but by reviewing materials and reading from the book, it helps me understand 
        so much better and I was able to complete the project. On the other hand, since I am not taking Client-Side, CIS 3344,
        I had some hard time doing my own research on CSS to make the client page look presentable and clear to the user.
    </p>
    <!--Project 2-->
    <h3>Project 2</h3>
    <p>The 2nd project gives me experience with creating web applications by using GridView control and dynamic binding. I designed a Book Store in this project,
        list all book options in a GridView for user to pick and make the order. In this project, I only need to create one single ASPX webpage, and learn 
        to create a postback webpage, which  the entire page and its content are sent to the server for processing information and then the server posts the same page 
        back to the browser.
    </p>
    <p>This is a good project and I learned a lot from it. I had less trouble with this project than the first one, as I got more familar and I used the same CSS layout 
        from project 1 for this one.
    </p>
    <!--Project 3-->
    <h3>Project 3</h3>
    <p>This project give me more experience building multi-tier web applications. In this project, I developed 
        a small-scale restaurant review system, like Yelp or Grubhub but without food odering. This is a multi-page 
        web application. Thir project helps me gain experience working with database and designing a good data model 
        for the web application. It allows me to demonstrate data modelling skills, creating stored procedure, and 
        working with managing and maintaining state.
    </p>
    <p>This is a very very long and hard project. It tooks really long to finish this project, mostly because of 
    the thought process, how to make the database relation logically and then execute it using code behind. Overall, 
    althought this project gave me so much stress, it was a very useful project, since I have learned so much from it.
